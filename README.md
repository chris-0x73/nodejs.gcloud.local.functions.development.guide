### NodeJS Google Cloud Local Functions Development Guide.

Please read this whole document. Please read the comments in each template function in `index.js`.

### how to install:

#### #1 gcloud

To install gcloud CLI tool ( necessary for deploying functions ):
follow this link [https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
If the installer asks you to install python, but you already have python installed
(check if you do with `which python` on mac/linux and `where python` on windows), I would suggest
not installing an extra python as it may lead you to being very confused about which python is doing what on your computer.

#### #2 this project

To install this project to your machine ( line by line, not all together )

```
cd myProjectsFolder
git clone git@github.com:basiclaser/nodejs.gcloud.local.development.guide.git
cd nodejs.gcloud.local.development.guide
npm install
```

Treat this local project like a normal GIT project. Make commits as you make changes. This will enable you to roll back to previous versions if you make a mistake.

### development:

Working from a local project such as this is recommended over clicking through the google cloud platform to set up functions for a number of reasons. First, you get a real text editor that can lint, validate and format your code. It's also much faster to locally test than constantly redeploying your code to test it. Most importantly you can use version control (GIT) to protect your work over time. It would be very dangerous to directly create and edit cloud functions on the google cloud platform website, as you could accidentally break/delete things without any backups.

You can edit your cloud functions in the `index.js` file. Don't delete the comments, as they tell gcloud which functions are which. To test your functions locally (skips rebuild time), run:

```
npx @google-cloud/functions-framework --target=http_template
```

or you can make your own run scripts for your functions in package.json

```
npm run http_template
```

this runs the http_template function in index.js. Then you'll get a URL such as `http://192.168.178.29:8080/` that you can test with - this is a local equivalent of the usual "webhook" URL.

I recommend using the REST client ([link](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient)) VSCode plugin to organise and write test requests to your HTTP functions (I've made an example in HTTP/post.http).

### deployment:

To deploy the http_template function, for gcloud internal use only:

```
gcloud functions deploy http_template --runtime nodejs14 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --ingress-settings=internal-only
```

To deploy the pubsub function, and set its trigger to the "MYTOPIC" topic:

```
gcloud functions deploy pubsub_template --runtime nodejs14 --trigger-topic=MYTOPIC
```

Successful deployment will require an active project on Google Cloud Platform, as well as activation of any used APIs (in this case just cloud functions). Running the above commands will likely direct you to finish any necessary setup if your account isn't already set up with the relevant APIs.
